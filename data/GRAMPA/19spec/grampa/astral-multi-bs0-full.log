# OPTIONS INFO:
# Option                                Current setting               Current action
# -h1                                   All                           GRAMPA will search these H1 nodes. If none are specified, all nodes will be searched as H1 nodes.
# -h2                                   All                           GRAMPA will search these H2 nodes. If none are specified, all nodes will be searched as H2 nodes.
# -c                                    15                            Gene trees with more than this number of groups/clades with polyploid species for a given h1/h2 combination will be skipped.
# -f                                    astral-multi-bs0-full         All output files generated will have this string preprended to them.
# -p                                    30                            GRAMPA will use this number of processes for LCA mapping.
# -v                                    3                             Controls the amount of info printed to the screen as GRAMPA is running.
# --multree                             False                         The tree input with -s will be read as singly-labeled tree.
# --checknums                           False                         GRAMPA will count groups to filter gene trees and then perform reconciliations.
# --no-st, --st-only                    default                       GRAMPA will perform reconciliations to all MUL-trees specified by -h1 and -h2 and the input species tree.
# --maps                                False                         GRAMPA will only output duplication and loss counts in the detailed output file.
